This repository contains the solution for The Odin Project's Recipes lesson, part of the Foundations curriculum (https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes).

## Project Overview

This project is a basic recipe website created as a learning exercise to solidify foundational HTML skills. The goal was to demonstrate the ability to structure a simple website using HTML, incorporating elements like headings, paragraphs, lists, links, and images.

**Key Features:**

- **Recipe Pages:** Individual HTML pages for each recipe, detailing ingredients and instructions. Currently includes recipes for:
    - Arepas
    - Marquesa de Chocolate
    - Teque√±os
- **Images:** Inclusion of relevant images for each recipe to enhance visual appeal.
- **Basic HTML Structure:**  Utilizes semantic HTML elements to structure content logically.

**Technologies Used:**

- **HTML:**  The primary language for structuring the content of the website.

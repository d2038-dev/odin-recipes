    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Marquesa de Chocolate is a decadent and incredibly popular Venezuelan dessert, often described as a no-bake
        chocolate cake or a rich chocolate mousse. It's characterized by its smooth, creamy texture and intense
        chocolate flavor, making it a perfect treat for chocolate lovers.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>2 1⁄2 packages Maria Galletas or Maria Cookies (easily found in the Latino aisle of most grocery stores)
        </li>
        <li>2 bars semi-sweet chocolate (or 1 bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips)</li>
        <li>1 stick butter</li>
        <li>1 can sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp liquor of your choice, divided. Recommended: rum, brandy or Bailey’s Original Irish Cream.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Melt the butter and the chocolate in a saucepan over low heat, breaking the chocolate into pieces and
            stirring constantly.</li>
        <li>Add the condensed milk to the butter and chocolate mixture. Mix well.</li>
        <li>Stir in 1 Tbsp of your liquor of choice. The consistency should be not too thick, not too runny. Add a
            splash of milk, if you need to thin the mixture.</li>
        <li>In a shallow bowl, mix the milk, vanilla extract and 1 Tbsp of liquor.</li>
        <li>Dip each Maria Cookie into the milk–vanilla-liquor mixture and place in a single layer In a 9 x 13” glass
            baking dish. Be careful not to dip the cookie for too long or it will break. Fill in the spaces between the
            cookies with smaller, broken pieces.</li>
        <li>Pour and spread ⅓ of the chocolate mixture over the cookie layer, making sure it is spread evenly across the
            top of all the cookies.</li>
        <li>Repeat steps 5 and 6 two more times, so there are 3 layers total of Maria Cookies and the chocolate mixture.
        </li>
        <li>Take the remaining cookies and break them into tiny pieces, using a food processor or put them in a zip bag
            and crumble them by hand. Pour an even, final layer of cookie crumbles evenly on the top-most chocolate
            layer.</li>
        <li>Put the cake in the freezer for at least 2 hours before taking it out and cutting into squares. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
